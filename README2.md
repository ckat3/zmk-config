custom layout I made for my [A. Dux](https://github.com/tapioki/cephalopoda/tree/main/Architeuthis%20dux). a couple of ergonomical choices were made with the Dux in mind, but it will work fine in any 34-key layout.

i haven't really explored anything else since mid-2022, after studying and playing around with a host of other layouts. i find it a joy to use; the annoyances are minimal, and i think i'll be carrying around with me for a long time still (tho i sometimes ask myself if it could be nice to have a couple of extra keys for some very specific cases).

i ran some benchmarks for fun, and it tends to agglutinate with every other top-ranking layout. it has been optimized for english and french by statistical analysis of a personal corpus, but i also made sure that it works great for portuguese, spanish, and various kinds of coding. it also has umlaut and eszett, but the sfb rate dies rise a little when writing german.

features:
 * low on SFBs and redirects and high on alternation, but
 * still features some very enjoyable rolls (`'s`, `you`, `which`…)
 * lower row favored to the upper (personal choice) 
 * number layer with 0-3 on the home row, which will change your life
 * left side made to optionally complement shortcuts and gestures i have on the mouse (enter, cut, copy, paste), but
 * entirely mouse-independent, with mouse movement on a utilitiy layer
 * shortcuts for clipboard log, light/dark windows theme switch, and external screen controls (powered by autohotkey and controlmymonitor)

being based on bépo instead of qwerty (ugh) or azerty (EUGH), it also gives you access to several rarer symbols. i can't say i use any of them on a regular basis, except for the narrow non-breaking space for french. (as to bépo's chic inverted comma, i think i threw that out the window.)

shouldn't be much of a hassle to adapt it to something else, anyway — provided the code is legible, which i haven't always been polite enough to ensure! either way, the `.keymap` has a few macros that could be useful for other projects too.

feel free to fork and/or steal ideas, and let me know what you think!
