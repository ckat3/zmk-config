Rather complicated layout for an A. Dux (or any 34-key shield, tho some ergonomics are made with the Dux in mind). 

Optimized for French, English and coding, with useful functions for Portuguese, Spanish and I guess you could say German (it has an eszett!).

I spend too much time on this. It's a hobby project and probably won't be of much interest to anyone else, though I would eventually like to write a little documentation since it does have a feature or two that could be of use.
